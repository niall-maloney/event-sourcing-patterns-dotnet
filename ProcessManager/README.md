# Process Manager

The process manager pattern in event sourcing is like the glue that coordinates complex business processes. It listens
for specific events and then triggers the next steps in the process, ensuring everything happens in the right order.
Think of it as an orchestrator that keeps track of the state of a multi-step workflow and makes sure all the pieces come
together smoothly.
